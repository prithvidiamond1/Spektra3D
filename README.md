# Spektra

Real-time audio visualizer made using [miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio), [Imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), [IIR1](https://github.com/berndporr/iir1) and [Implot](https://github.com/epezent/implot) libraries. 

Audio analysis is achieved using bandpass filters to perform fractional-octave analysis which is then processed and displayed to make pleasing visuals in real-time.

Audio sources for visualization are currently limited to only WASAPI loopback (Windows) audio.
